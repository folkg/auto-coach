# Auto Coach Infrastructure

Complete Infrastructure as Code for the Auto Coach application using OpenTofu/Terraform with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Auto Coach uses a **hybrid cloud architecture** combining Google Cloud Platform and Firebase services:

### **Cloud Infrastructure**
- **Google Cloud Run**: Containerized API server (Bun compiled binary)
- **Google Artifact Registry**: Container image storage
- **Google Secret Manager**: Secure API key storage
- **Google Cloud Storage**: OpenTofu state management

### **Firebase Services**
- **Firebase Hosting**: Angular frontend deployment
- **Firebase Functions**: Serverless backend functions (lineup, transactions, email, auth)
- **Firebase Firestore**: NoSQL database
- **Firebase Authentication**: User authentication

### **External Integrations**
- **SendGrid**: Email delivery service
- **Yahoo Fantasy Sports API**: Fantasy sports data

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

Run the interactive setup script for a complete guided deployment:

```bash
cd infrastructure/opentofu
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Check prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Set up Google Cloud authentication
- ‚úÖ Enable required APIs
- ‚úÖ Create state bucket
- ‚úÖ Configure secrets
- ‚úÖ Deploy infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Provide next steps

## üîí Security & Secret Management

### Secret Manager Integration

Sensitive credentials are stored in Google Secret Manager:

- **SendGrid API Key**: `sendgrid-api-key-{environment}`
- **Yahoo Client Secret**: `yahoo-client-secret-{environment}`

Non-sensitive configuration is passed as environment variables:
- CORS origins
- Firebase project ID
- Yahoo App ID and Client ID

### Security Features

- ‚úÖ **Non-root container execution** (UID 1001)
- ‚úÖ **Distroless container images** (minimal attack surface)
- ‚úÖ **Environment-specific IAM policies**
- ‚úÖ **Encrypted secret storage**
- ‚úÖ **CORS properly configured**
- ‚úÖ **Principle of least privilege**

## üê≥ Container Deployment

### Build and Deploy Container

```bash
# From repository root
cd ../../

# Build the API binary (optimized for Cloud Run)
cd server/api
bun run build

# Build container image
cd ../../
bun run container:build

# Tag and push to Artifact Registry
SERVICE_URL=$(cd infrastructure/opentofu && tofu output -raw container_registry_url)
docker tag auto-coach-api $SERVICE_URL/auto-coach-api:latest
docker push $SERVICE_URL/auto-coach-api:latest

# The Cloud Run service will automatically deploy the new image
```

### Container Optimizations

- **Compiled Binary**: Bun builds to a single executable
- **Distroless Base**: Minimal container size (~10MB)
- **Linux Target**: Optimized for Cloud Run environment
- **Fast Cold Starts**: Optimized health checks and startup

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### Development Environment
- **Scales to zero** when not in use
- **Pay-per-request** pricing
- **Minimal resource allocation**
- **No persistent instances**

### Production Environment
- **Auto-scaling** based on traffic
- **Efficient resource utilization**
- **Optimized container images**
- **Cost monitoring via Google Cloud Console**

### Cost Estimates
- **Development**: $0-5/month (scales to zero)
- **Production**: $10-50/month (depends on traffic)
- **State Storage**: <$1/month
- **Secret Manager**: <$1/month

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

### Automated GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository uses modern, monorepo-aware GitHub Actions for infrastructure and application deployment. The workflows are located in `.github/workflows/` at the repo root.

#### Infrastructure Deployment

- **Path-based triggers:** Any change to `infrastructure/**` triggers a plan and (on `main`) an apply.
- **OpenTofu:** Uses `opentofu/setup-opentofu` for IaC.
- **Google Cloud Auth:** Uses `google-github-actions/auth` for secure credentials.
- **Plan and Apply:** Plans are always run; applies only on `main` or via manual dispatch.
- **Deployment Records:** Each deployment is committed to the repo for traceability.

#### Example: Infrastructure Workflow

See `.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml` for the full workflow.

Key steps:
- Validate and plan changes with OpenTofu
- Apply changes to GCP on merge to `main`
- Commit deployment logs to `docs/deployments/`
- Notify PRs of plan/apply status

#### Application Deployment

- **Change Detection:** Only deploys API/Functions or Client if their code or shared code changes.
- **API & Functions:** Built and deployed together (Cloud Run + Firebase Functions).
- **Client:** Built and deployed to Firebase Hosting.
- **Preview Deployments:** PRs get client previews on Firebase Hosting.
- **Conventional Commits:** All deployments and logs follow conventional commit standards.

#### Manual Deployment

You can trigger infrastructure deployments manually via the GitHub Actions UI using the workflow_dispatch event in the infrastructure workflow.

#### Best Practices

- Always check the Actions tab for deployment status.
- Use PRs for all changes; merges to `main` are automatically deployed.
- For emergency fixes, use a hotfix branch and PR.


## üîÑ State Management

### Remote State (Google Cloud Storage)

State is automatically stored in Google Cloud Storage for:
- ‚úÖ **Team collaboration**
- ‚úÖ **State locking**
- ‚úÖ **Backup and versioning**
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD integration**

State bucket: `auto-coach-terraform-state`

### State Commands

```bash
# List resources in state
make state-list

# Show detailed state for a resource
make state-show

# Refresh state from actual infrastructure
make refresh ENVIRONMENT=dev PROJECT_ID=your-project FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase
```

## üöÄ Migration & Future Plans

### Current Hybrid Architecture
- **Cloud Run**: API container
- **Firebase Functions**: Serverless functions
- **Firebase Hosting**: Frontend hosting

### Future Migration Path
As mentioned, you plan to migrate Firebase Functions into the API container. The current infrastructure supports this transition:

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Hybrid Cloud Run + Firebase Functions
2. **Phase 2** (Future): Consolidated Cloud Run + Firebase Hosting
3. **Phase 3** (Optional): Full Google Cloud (Cloud Run + Cloud CDN)

The OpenTofu configuration is designed to evolve with these changes.
