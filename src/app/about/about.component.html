    <h1>About The Fantasy Autopilot</h1>
    <p>
      Fantasy Autopilot will optimize and set your fantasy lineups automatically
      every day on your behalf. You won't have to lift a finger. Just set up
      your team once and let it do the work for the rest of the season.
    </p>
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Optimize Lineups</strong><br />
        The best lineup for each day (or week) is determined based on player
        projections, crowd-sourced player rankings, announced starters, and
        injury information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Last Minute Lineup Changes</strong><br />
        If a player is injured or announced as a starter late in the day, the
        lineup will be automatically updated again before each game starts. The
        changes will be made at :55 of the hour if there is an upcoming game.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Intelligent Use of Injury Spaces</strong><br />
        If there are healthy players on your IR, we will use them to fill in for
        a player who is injured on your starting lineup. Players will be
        automatically shuffled between your starting lineup and IR / IR+ / NA
        spaces if their eligibility allows for it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy to Use</strong><br />
        There is just one option. On or Off. You can set it and forget it.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <div class="grid-item why">
        <p>
          Fantasy Autopilot was created because I was tired of having to
          manually set my lineups every day. I wanted to spend more time
          enjoying the season and less time on the monotonous tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also wanted to create a tool that would help me win my league. I
          wanted to be able to focus on the strategy of the season and not have
          to worry about the day-to-day minutiae. Many points are lost because
          of poor lineup decisions, forgetting to set your lineups, or not being
          aware of last minute, real-life, roster moves. This tool aims to
          eliminate all of those needless points stranded on the bench.

    <h2>How to Set Up</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="grid-item set-up">
        <p>
          Just log in with your Yahoo credentials and all of your teams will be
          presented to you. Just set the toggle to "On" and you're done. You can
          always come back set the toggle to "Off" if you want to turn it off
          for a particular team.

    <h2>What it Won't Do</h2>
    <p>
      Fantasy Autopilot will not make trades, adds, drops, or waiver wire
      pickups for you. It will not make any roster decisions for you. It will
      just optimize your lineup every day.
    </p>
    <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the things that are coming up:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Fill Rosters Positions for Injured Players</strong><br />
        If you have a player on your roster who is injured, we will move them to
        an open IR / IR+ / NA slot if space permits and fill that roster
        position with a healthy player from the free agency pool or waivers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Suggest Add and Drop Candidate Players</strong><br />
        We will suggest players to add and players drop based on their projected
        performance, hot streaks, the moves of other owners, and your team's
        needs.
